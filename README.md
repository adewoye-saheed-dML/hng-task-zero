# HNG Backend Wizards â€” Stage 0 Task

This is my submission for the **HNG Internship Backend Wizards Stage 0 Task**.  
The project implements a simple RESTful API with a `/me` endpoint that returns my profile information along with a dynamic **cat fact** fetched from the [Cat Facts API](https://catfact.ninja/fact).

---

## Features
- GET `/me` endpoint
- Returns JSON response with:
  - `status`: always `"success"`
  - `user`: email, full name, and backend stack
  - `timestamp`: current UTC time in ISO 8601 format
  - `fact`: random cat fact from Cat Facts API
- Handles errors gracefully if the Cat Facts API is down
- Uses environment variables for configuration

---

## Tech Stack
- **Node.js**
- **Express.js**
- **Axios**
- **Dotenv** (for environment variables)
